# Advanced Programming: Exam 3 Solution - Classification and Model Building

This repository contains the solution for the third and final mock exam in the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The exam integrates all major topics covered in the course: advanced data preprocessing, core algorithmic problem-solving, and the implementation of Machine Learning classification models.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **ML Classification:** Applying supervised learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) for binary classification on the medical dataset (`cancer.csv`).
* **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Implementing advanced techniques like **Imputation** for missing numerical values and **Normalization** (Z-Score Scaling) to prepare data for modeling.
* **Algorithmic Complexity:** Solving non-standard algorithmic problems involving matrix creation and complex sorting logic.
* **Model Evaluation:** Calculating and interpreting performance metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix) to validate the model.

## Repository Content

* **`Advanced_Programming_Test3.ipynb`**: Full Python solution notebook with code and analysis results for the exam.
* **`cancer.csv`**: The medical dataset used in the examination.
* **`docs/Test_Instructions_3.pdf`**: Original examination instructions.
